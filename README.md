# Vocabulary Quiz

Vocabulary Quiz is a language game that will allow the user to test their skills in English and German. The user can choose a topic by selecting a quiz type. The quiz is set up so that the user will find matching word pairs. Motivation is kept up by counting the number of attempts the user needs to find all word pairs. The user can try to find all words with the lowest possible amount of attempts.

## UX
### Colour Scheme

[Color Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=201773) and [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) have been used to find and test the colors. #201773 is used as the main color and as the background color for header and footer. The lighter color #553fa3 is used for the quiz type buttons. #201773 is used again when hovering over the quiz type buttons. #000047 is used when hovering over the german words buttons. To make sure these three colors contrast well with the color #fff, which is used a background and font color respectively, all colors were tested in a contrast checker.

### Typography 

Google Fonts has been used to find the font, that is displayed on the website. [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin?category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=Vocabulary%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) is described as having a touch of modernism as well as having a wide language support including all Western, Central and South/Eastern European languages, which was found suitable for a vocabulary language quiz.

To provide visual cues icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) have been used in the quiz type buttons and for the icon that links to Instagram.

### Wireframes

Wireframes created with Balsamiq were used to plan the layout of the website.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
  - Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so itâ€™s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used â€˜image1.pngâ€™ consider naming it â€˜landing_page_img.pngâ€™. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
